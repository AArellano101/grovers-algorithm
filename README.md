Grover's Algorithm ‘Oracle’ Quantum Circuit Designer

-Application of quantum computing, python and Qiskit library

-Used user input of any permutation and length of ‘0’s or ‘1’s to represent the sequence of qubits that the designed quantum circuit would flip the phase of in superposition, also known as the ‘oracle’ component of Grover’s search algorithm

-Developed and implemented designer through testing with x-gates, h-gates, z-gates and c-not gates
